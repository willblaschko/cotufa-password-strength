# Password Strength Calculator - Architecture Design

## 1. The Ask and Implementation Details

We are tasked with creating a Password Strength Calculator, a lightweight and responsive tool built entirely with native HTML and JavaScript. The calculator will provide real-time feedback on password strength, offering detailed analysis and suggestions for improvement.

Key implementation details:
- Use only native HTML and JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks)
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Implement real-time password strength evaluation
- Provide detailed feedback and suggestions
- Ensure all processing is done client-side for privacy

## 3. Details About Each File

### index.html
The main HTML file that structures the web page. It will include:
- A title and brief description of the tool
- An input field for the password
- A display area for the strength meter
- A section for detailed feedback and suggestions

### css/styles.css
Contains all the styles for the application, including:
- Layout and positioning of elements
- Styling for the input field, strength meter, and feedback area
- Responsive design rules for various screen sizes

### js/main.js
The main JavaScript file that handles:
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners for user input
- Updating the UI based on password strength

### js/passwordStrength.js
A separate module for password strength calculation logic:
- Functions to evaluate password length, complexity, and character variety
- Algorithm to calculate overall password strength
- Generation of specific improvement suggestions

### docs/architecture_design.md
This file, containing the architectural overview and design decisions.

### .gitignore
Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control.

## Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: We've separated the password strength logic (passwordStrength.js) from the main application logic (main.js) to improve maintainability and potential reusability.

2. **No External Dependencies**: As per the requirements, we're using only native HTML and JavaScript, ensuring lightweight and fast performance across all modern browsers.

3. **Real-Time Feedback**: We'll use event listeners on the password input field to trigger strength calculations and UI updates as the user types.

4. **Client-Side Processing**: All password evaluation will be done in the browser to ensure user privacy and security.

5. **Responsive Design**: We'll use CSS media queries and flexible layouts to ensure the tool works well on various screen sizes.

6. **Modular Structure**: By separating concerns into different files (HTML structure, CSS styles, core logic, and password strength calculation), we create a modular and maintainable codebase.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the Password Strength Calculator, ensuring it meets all the specified requirements while remaining efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
